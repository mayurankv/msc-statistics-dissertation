Setup:
	☐ Choose project
		☐ Think about type of financial data you are keen to analyse
		☐ Think about what kind of time series research question you want to build around it
	☐ Update the module names and descriptions to reflect thesis
	☐ Populate `Makefile` with relevant commands
	☐ Store argument in `yaml` files (rest set as CONSTANTS in file)

	Logging:
		☐ Set up logging decorators
		☐ Choose logging format
		☐ Set multiple logging sinks
			☐ `stdout`
			☐ Logging files
		☐ Look into `loguru` (https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)
		☐ Read `logging` cookbook

	Deployment:
		GUI:
			☐ Use
		CLI:
			☐ Look into `Typer`
			☐ Look into `argparse`

	Environment:
		☐ Convert `environment.yml` to `requirements.txt`
		☐ Setup `mamba` (https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/configuration.html)

Data:
	Bloomberg data:
		☐ Contact relevant person for access
		☐ Work out how to use via python
	☐ Find other financial data sources

Concepts to Learn:
	Speeding up:
		Profiling:
			☐ Look into `cProfile`
			☐ Look into `Snakeviz`
			☐ Look into other tools
		Just in Time Compilation:
			☐ Research concept
			☐ Research `numba`
			☐ Research `jax`
			☐ Research `pypy`
			☐ Research `pyston`
		Parallelism:
			☐ Look into `multiprocessing`
				☐ `from multiprocessing import Pool`
			☐ Use vectorisation
		Concurrency:
			☐ Look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrency.html
			☐ Asynchronisation
				☐ Use `asyncio`
		Caching:
			☐ `functools` caching via `@lru_cache`
			☐ Streamlit caching
		C Code:
			☐ Look into `Cython`
			☐ Look at how native `C` code can be called
		Other Examples:
			☐ Look into `concurrent.futures`
			☐ Look into `threading`
