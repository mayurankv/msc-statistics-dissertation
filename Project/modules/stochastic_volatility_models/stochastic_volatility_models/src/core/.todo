- Test vol surface
- Implement objective functions
- Implement fitting
- Finish heston model by Friday


1.
Objective Functions:
	☐ Need volatility surface structure first
		☐ Need data first
Fitting Heston:
	☐ Need objective functions
Simulating Heston:
	☐
Integrated Volatility:
	☐

2.
Get data:
	☐ Store
	☐ Be able to pull

3.
Overall volatility surfaces:
	☐ Interpolation? Spline?
	☐ Conversion of strikes to log moneyness
	☐ Converion of expiries to T2X

4.
General simulation of paths:
General fitting parameters:
