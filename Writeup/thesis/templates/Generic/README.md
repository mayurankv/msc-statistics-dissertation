# PhD Thesis

This repository contains my PhD thesis, which is at the current state still in an (almost finished) draft state.
The purpose of this repo is mainly to rebuild Aaron Turon's thesis template, see [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/263586/37762) SE question/answer.

However (as I'm approching my thesis deadline) the template is more like in a half-done state.
I'm not experienced in writing LaTeX class files, so there is definitely space for improvement regarding what should be part of the classfile and what not (on example is that the biblatex package is loaded in the classfile -- I guess this should be moved to the main .tex file -- but I will only take care of these things after I handed in the thesis).
Thus I would be happy about any feedback on how to improve this template, and I hope someone will find this useful/interesting.
