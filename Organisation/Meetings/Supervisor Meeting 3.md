[Mayuran Visakan=teal, Adam Sykulski=red, Chiara Ottino=indigo, Weinan He=orange, Francesco Ventura=pink]

< Mayuran Visakan | I explained my ideas from ... | 11/06/2024, 13:21:25

> Adam Sykulski | Good | 11/06/2024, 13:21:34

> Adam Sykulski | Simulated data if real data is ahrd | 11/06/2024, 13:21:38

> Adam Sykulski | Look at misspecified models - Generate simulated data from one of the models and fit the others to it and see how nicely they fit it | 11/06/2024, 13:21:48

> Adam Sykulski | Might struggle with real parameters if model is misspecified in terms of orders or parameters near limits | 11/06/2024, 13:22:52

> Adam Sykulski | Other issues like where volatility is symmetric - where models do jump and spit a bit so might not be as good as other models | 11/06/2024, 13:23:14

> Adam Sykulski | Good to focus on recent data as markets change | 11/06/2024, 13:26:18

> Adam Sykulski | Discretising SDE into short intervals Euler-Mariana | 11/06/2024, 13:31:33

> Weinan He | Going to do NASDAQ (or S&P) and FTSE | 11/06/2024, 13:32:25

> Weinan He | He was going to look at ARIMA-GARCH but going to extend to ARMAX | 11/06/2024, 13:40:20

> Weinan He | Used ARMAX to remove stationarity. Compared results with ARIMAX and ARIMA. For S&P ARIMA is better but ARIMAX better for FTSE | 11/06/2024, 13:42:49

# Speak to Weinan and find out exactly what he's doing

> Chiara Ottino | Chiara having issues with loading data | 11/06/2024, 13:51:48

> Francesco Ventura | Looking at extreme value theory for peak performance - specifically acceleration | 11/06/2024, 14:00:05

> Chiara Ottino | Going to be looking at topics from big data on streaming data such as changepoints and ... and rolling windows | 11/06/2024, 14:01:53

> Chiara Ottino | Wants to create online measures, then build a model based on that to look at change detection | 11/06/2024, 14:03:48

# Chiara is doing stuff with online changepoint detection where online means live time and offline means after the event with all theinformation. So identifying changepoints live.

...
# More conversation about sports stuff I didn't minute

> Chiara Ottino | Chiara is with Man United | 11/06/2024, 14:22:06

> Francesco Ventura | Francesco is with Newcastle | 11/06/2024, 14:22:18
